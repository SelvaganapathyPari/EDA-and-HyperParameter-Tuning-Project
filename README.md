# EDA and HyperParameter Tuning Project

The main goal of this jupyter notebook is to perform EDA and Hyperparameter optimization to improve the accuracy or performance. 
### please note - Hyperparameter tuning soley dependant on the problem statement and business requirements from the client. however, in this project my aim was to improve accuracy from the standard modeling
